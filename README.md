# Linear Regression with one feature

I used the model linear regression with one feaure 

$$
f({x}_{1})={\theta}_{0}+{\theta}_{1}{x}_{1}
$$

Applied to a Happiness dataset Choosing

* $X$= `Health (Life Expectancy)`
* $Y$= `Happiness Score`

Using visualizations with `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and the ML models of `scikitlearn`, here i concluded that the equation of the model is 

$$
f({x}_{1})=3.3+3.8{x}_{1}
$$

Wich fits the data with a *mean squared error* of $0.5$
